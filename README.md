## Overview
Medical insurance cost prediction helps insurance companies estimate premiums and assess financial risk more accurately.  
This project builds a regression model that predicts insurance charges using demographic and health related data.

The notebook covers data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Problem Statement
Given personal and lifestyle related attributes, predict the medical insurance cost charged to an individual.

The target variable is a continuous numerical value representing insurance charges.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about insurance customers.

Each row represents one individual  
Each column represents a personal or medical attribute  
The target column represents the insurance charges

## Features Used
Common features used in the model include:
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Body mass index
4. Number of children
5. Smoking status
6. Region

Categorical features are encoded before training the model.

## Approach
1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Handle missing values if present
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Perform feature analysis
5. Split data into training and testing sets
6. Train a regression model
7. Evaluate model performance
8. Predict insurance costs for new inputs

## Machine Learning Model
This project uses a supervised regression algorithm.

Linear Regression is used as the baseline model to learn the relationship between input features and insurance charges.

The model is chosen because:
1. It is simple and interpretable
2. It performs well on linear relationships
3. It provides a strong baseline for cost prediction problems

## Evaluation Metrics
Model performance is evaluated using regression metrics such as:
1. R squared score
2. Mean Absolute Error
3. Mean Squared Error

These metrics help measure how close predicted costs are to actual values.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local system
2. Ensure Python version 3.8 or higher is installed
3. Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
4. Run all cells sequentially

## Results
The trained model predicts medical insurance costs with reasonable accuracy.

Performance depends on data quality, feature encoding, and preprocessing choices.

## Technologies Used
1. Python
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Scikit learn
5. Matplotlib
6. Seaborn
7. Jupyter Notebook

## Future Improvements
1. Try advanced regression models such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting
2. Perform hyperparameter tuning
3. Add feature scaling
4. Handle outliers more effectively
5. Apply cross validation for better generalization
